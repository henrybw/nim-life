Game of Life written in Nim

Note: The build/link scripts in crosscompile/ are specifically to support cross-compiling between OS X and Linux, i.e. compiling Nim -> C on Linux, and C -> native on OS X. For self-hosting dev environments, there are build/run scripts in the root (which just run `nim compile` like normal).
